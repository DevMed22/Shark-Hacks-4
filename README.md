# Shark-Hacks-4

Do you want to explore the ocean like Nemo without getting eaten by sharks? we have a quiz for you. If you pass it you may survive a shark attack.

## Inspiration
Many people couldn't servive when they swim inside the sea, so we came with and idea ,answer a quiz so you can servive and appear on the scoreboard!

## What it does
It's something like a compitition people who servive more appear first on scoreboard!

## How we built it
We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap for Frontend. We used Python/Django to build the Backend, we used Github actions to test our functionality in every pull request to the repo and reviweing it.

## Challenges we ran into
We had some errors and made our search to solve them. The time was challenging although we began our project just 24 hours ago. We face some problems dealing with GitHub repo to distribute work between us but with try and error we got our way. We faced some problems in connecting the frontend to the backend as we are developing our Django app in a short time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have built this project in less than 24 hour from zero to hero We collaborated together in a professional way through using GitHub and Discord. The pair programming was really great skill to practice and we enjoyed the process and proud of our progress.

## What we learned
We have sharpened our teamwork skills through distributing workload and managing our work using GitHub project boards. Everyone has sharpened his technology and understanding of it within the context of a complete project through integration of different technologies. Brainstorming our ideas together and respecting others opinions and suggestions so finally we vote for our best solution.

## What's next for Sharkira
We've an idea to use NLP and Cohere to apply these funcionality to our project in the Questions section, we built text generation model using co:here to generate texts about shark's information.
Add a Frame and Picture profile that look sharky.
Add more games to help you survive.
